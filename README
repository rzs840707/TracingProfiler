Summary:
A profiler that reports on the number of method invocations, the total time 
    spent in each method, and the total number of object instantiations. 
Uses the ASM library for bytecode transformations to inject code the start and 
    stop of every method to track how long each method invocation takes, as
    well as how many times the method is called. 
Also counts the number of objects of each type that are created.

Usage: 
java -javaagent:tracer.jar SomeTestProgram
