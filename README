Summary:
A profiler that reports on the number of method invocations, the total time 
    spent in each method, and the total number of object instantiations. 
Uses Java agents and the ASM library for bytecode transformations to inject 
    code the start and stop of every method to track how long each method 
    invocation takes, as well as how many times the method is called. 
Also counts the number of objects of each type that are created.
Uses a shutdown hook to correlate the data and output it to standard out.

Usage: 
java -javaagent:tracer.jar SomeTestProgram
